<h1> Testing Site, Please read carefully </h1>

I have added support for the following printers:

- Prusa Mini/Mini+
- Ender 3 Vanilla (Running Marling)

Now, you can download the correct config file for your printer directly from the webpage. Just choose your printer and hit "Download Config"

Rest of the process is same as before, as show in the youtube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSpqXZ8SoI)

Please understand that I do not own these printers so a little bit of back and forth would be required between you, the tester and myself.

Watchout for 2 major things:

- There should be no purge line printed.
- Printer should pause for you to load the first filament before it starts the print.

Please report any issues directly on the comments of the youtube video or via an email to createincvideos@gmail.com

Please report any successes you have and don't forget to tag me on instagram if you post the pictures [@create.inc01](https://www.instagram.com/create.inc01/)
